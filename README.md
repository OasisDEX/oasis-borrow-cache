# Oasis Borrow cache

This package parses blockchain data and builds comprehensive data set about Maker Vaults used by
Oasis Borrow. To build most up to date live data project utilizes
[Spock ðŸ––](https://github.com/OasisDEX/spock).

<REFERENCE HERE SPOCK LEARNING MATERIALS>

## Project brake down

- `etl` process handles fetching data from blockchain, processes it and saves to data base.
- `api` process creates readonly graphql api from database views.

## Getting Started

Requirements:

- Docker
- node.js (version 12.\*)
- yarn

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OasisDEX/oasis-borrow-cache.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
3. Create `.env.local` in the root of the project with content to set/override environment
   variables. In order to create borrow history you will need to supply an url to jsonrpc node.

   Here you may also override `VL_CHAIN_NAME=mainnet`. You may set it to `mainnet` or `kovan` or
   `localnet` but remember to also provide proper jsonrpc node.

   ```
   VL_CHAIN_HOST= <HERE PASTE AN URL TO JSONRPC NODE FROM WHERE YOU WISH TO FETCH BLOCKCHAIN DATA>
   ```

4. Run database
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh
   ```
5. Run migrations
   ```
   yarn migrate
   ```
   NOTE: Use node version 12
6. Run `etl` process
   ```
   yarn start-etl
   ```
   NOTE: Use node version 12
7. Run `api` process
   ```
   yarn start-api
   ```

## Database structure

### Schema: `cat` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/cat.sol)

- `bite` - Holds pure Bite events emitted by Cat.

### Schema: `clipper` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/clip.sol)

- `kick` - Holds pure Kick events emitted by clippers. Event starting vault auction.
- `redo` - Holds pure Redo events emitted by clippers. Event restarting auction.
- `take` - Holds pure Take events emitted by clippers. Event when collateral is bought at the
  auction.
- `yank` - Holds pure Yank events emitted by clippers.

### Schema: `dog` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/dog.sol)

- `bark` - Holds pure Bark events emitted by Dog

### Schema: `flipper` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/flip.sol)

- `kick` - Holds pure kick function calls on flippers.
- `deal` - Holds pure deal function calls on flippers.
- `dent` - Holds pure dent function calls on flippers.
- `tend` - Holds pure tend function calls on flippers.

### Schema: `manager` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-cdp-manager/blob/master/src/DssCdpManager.sol)

- `cdp` - Holds information about vaults open via cdp manager.

### Schema: `vat` [contract source](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/vat.sol) [MakerDAO docs](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module/vat-detailed-documentation)

- `fold` - Holds pure fold function calls on vat. Updates rates for ilk.
- `fork` - Holds pure fork function calls on vat. Moves collateral and debt between vaults.
- `frob` - Holds pure frob function calls on vat. This call does debt and collateral changes on vault. 
- `grab` - Holds pure grab function calls on vat. Confiscates vault on liquidation.

### Schema: `vault`

- `events` - Aggregated events for vaults. Transformed from events or function calls. The values
  stored here are normalized.

Note: values saved from pure events or function calls are not normalized, they need to be divided by
`wad` `rad` or `ray`. [Read more](https://docs.makerdao.com/other-documentation/system-glossary)

## Unit tests

- For running tests you also need node v12

## Development notes

- Every bit of information saved to db needs to be referenced by block and transaction so when the
  reorg happens spock can remove such data from database
  ```
  tx_id                   integer not null REFERENCES vulcan2x.transaction(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  block_id                integer not null REFERENCES vulcan2x.block(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ```
- Remember to lowercase all addresses when saving them.
